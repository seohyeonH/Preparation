To get the money that you didn't receive, you'd need to clarify the context first. Are you referring to unpaid salary? A refund? An inheritance? 

For unpaid work or services, you can start by contacting your employer or the person who owes you to clarify the situation. If the person or company refuse to pay, you can resolve it through the South Korean labor board or even take it to court.

In the case of a refund, first you need to contact the service provider or seller. If they refuse to give you a refund, you can report it to the Korea Consumer Agency.

For unclaimed inheritance, consult with a lawyer to know the legal procedures you should follow.
