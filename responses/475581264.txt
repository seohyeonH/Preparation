You can consider the following steps to receive legal counsel in South Korea:

1. Find a Lawyer: Look for a lawyer who specializes in the area of law relevant to your case. You can get referrals from family, acquaintances, or use online platforms. The Korean Bar Association offers services to foreigners to help them find an appropriate lawyer.

2. Law Firm Consultation: Schedule a consultation with the law firm or lawyer. During the consultation, explain your situation in detail and ask any questions you may have.

3. Legal Aid: If you can't afford a private attorney, you can apply for free legal aid services provided by the government. The Korea Legal Aid Corporation and the Ministry of Justice both provide legal aid services.

4. Interpreter: If you do not understand or speak Korean fluently, consider hiring an interpreter. Some law firms in South Korea offer services in multiple languages.

5. Fees: Before you proceed, ensure you understand the lawyerâ€™s fee structure. Lawyers in South Korea usually charge by the hour or a flat fee, depending on the case. 

6. Attorney-Client Agreement: If you decide to hire the lawyer, you should sign an attorney-client agreement. This document describes the lawyer's responsibilities, legal fees, and the scope of the legal work to be performed.

Remember that it is advisable to consult with multiple lawyers or law firms before making a decision.
